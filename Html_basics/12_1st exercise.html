    <h2> <i>Introduction</i></h2><hr>
    <p><b>Monkey D. Luffy is the main protagonist of the popular anime and manga series One Piece, created by Eiichiro Oda.</b> <br> He is a brave, fun-loving, and strong-willed pirate who dreams of finding the legendary treasure known as the “One Piece” and becoming the King of the Pirates. <u> As a child, Luffy accidentally ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, a type of Devil Fruit that gave his body rubber-like properties, allowing him to stretch and bounce in extraordinary ways.</u> <br> He is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, a crew he formed as he traveled across the seas. <br> Despite his carefree and often silly personality, Luffy has a deep sense of loyalty and justice, always protecting his friends and fighting against oppression. <br>His adventurous spirit, determination, and belief in freedom inspire those around him. <br> Luffy's journey takes him through the dangerous Grand Line, where he faces powerful enemies, makes loyal allies, and uncovers world-changing secrets.</p><br>
