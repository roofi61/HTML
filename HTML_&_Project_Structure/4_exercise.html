            Naruto grows up as an orphan in the Hidden Leaf Village (Konoha). When he was a baby, a powerful demon fox called the Nine-Tails attacked the village. To save everyone, the Fourth Hokage sealed the beast inside Naruto. Because of this, many people in the village feared and avoided him.

Despite his lonely and difficult childhood, Naruto never gave up. He trained hard, made friends, and slowly earned the trust and respect of others. Along the way, he faced many powerful enemies and went on dangerous missions with his teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake.
